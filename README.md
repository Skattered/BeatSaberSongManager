# BeatSaberSongManager

Just a slightly easier way to delete a bunch of songs.

## Usage
 - Download rar from release
 - Extract, run exe

### Save
 - Saves current protected state of all songs to a .json file in the current app dir. The protected status will copy back over on launch
### Update
 - Forces an update of the songs if it doesn't update correctly after deleting, save before pushing this if you want to keep protected status
### Select all
 - Select anything that's not protected so you can mass delete quicker
### Delete
 - Confirmation box will pop up listing the folders that you're about to delete so you can verify it's all songs, hitting yes will delete them all.
